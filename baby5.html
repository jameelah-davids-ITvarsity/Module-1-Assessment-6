       <h3>Product Details</h3>

       <p>Does you little one not want to leave the bath because they have to stop playing? Well, these baby blocks can be enjoyed before, during and after bath time. They can switch from floating blocks to stacking blocks in a matter of seconds - and vice versa! They are educational, fun and completely baby proof (or should I say chewing proof too). Suitable for Toddlers 6 months to 2 years.</p>
       <p>Baby proof design:<br>
        - Soft bath baby blocks made of food-grade silicone, BPA Free, Safe and Non-toxic.<br>
        - Easy to clean - dirt just wipes right off.<br>
        - Smooth edges and soft material are safe for children.<br>
        </p>
       <p>Educational toys:<br>
        - Develop early recognition of shapes, numbers amd animals.<br>
        - Improving kids hand-eye coordination<br>
        - The bumps and grooves of the blocks are great for little hands to grip.<br>
        </p>
       <p>Teething toys:<br>
        - The silicon material has made these blocks useful when teething.<br>
        </p>
       <p>Super Fun for Baby:<br>
        Your baby will have endless fun with these bath toys in and out of the water. Mom and dad will be even happier as baby is improving hand-on ability, mototr learning and getting an early sense of geometry.
        </p>
       <p>Tips:<br>
        Wash before baby first use to get rid of any dust during transport, as most things go straight into the mouth.
